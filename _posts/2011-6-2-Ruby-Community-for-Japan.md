title: "Rubyists Coming Together For Japan"
---

Japan is under worst natural & nuclear disaster ever – earthquake, followed by Tsumani and nuclear radiation threats struck off the North East coast of Japan resulting in massive devastation and human casualties. At this time, hundreds of thousands are without shelter, power, food or water and the conditions are quickly deteriorating.

Japan is the birthplace of Ruby, and Ruby has made our lives collectively better. As Ruby on Rails developers, it is now our turn to focus our attention and efforts towards helping our friends, partners and the citizens of Japan. Supports are coming from all over the world – but not enough yet. As in other big disasters, the initial rescue and recovery work is only the first step of a long journey and as members of the Ruby community, we hope to make a difference one dollar at a time.

We invite & encourage you and your community to contribute as well. Please donate through [www.rubyistsforjapan.com](http://www.rubyistsforjapan.com/)
